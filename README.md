## UCD Sympa Data Source Exports

A quick project to quickly loop through a list of major codes and pulls the associated students in the IAM system. It writes the student's email address to a text file associated with the major export item. 

From there an admin could send that text file over to a web server hosted site to be used as a data source for a Sympa list.
